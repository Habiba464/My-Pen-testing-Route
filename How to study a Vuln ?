📝 Note: Keep a learning journal or markdown file for key takeaways.

 2. 🧑‍💻 Study Vulnerable Code**

To better understand how vulnerabilities work, look at source code examples:

* Search code snippets related to a specific vulnerability (e.g., IDOR, XSS, SSRF).
* Use **ChatGPT** or **DeepSeek** to generate, understand, or explain vulnerable code.
* Reverse-engineer lab challenges to see what code mistakes led to the vuln.

 3. 🧪 Hands-On Labs

Practice what you learn in real-world-like environments:

*PortSwigger Labs (Web Security Academy)
*PentesterLab
*TryHackMe
*Hack The Box

📝 Take detailed notes from every lab:

* Vulnerability Name
* Description
* Exploitation steps
* Payloads used
* Prevention tips

 6. 🗂️ Organize Your Notes into a Methodology

Once you've covered the above, organize your notes into:

🔹 Recon checklist
🔹 Bug types with real examples
🔹 Payload cheatsheets
🔹 Testing methodology per vuln
🔹 Tool usage tips
🔹 Custom scripts/snippets

💡 Turn this into a personal GitHub repository or Notion workspace, and keep it updated as you learn.
